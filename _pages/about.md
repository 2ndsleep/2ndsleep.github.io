# About (I'm Flattered You Care)

At the expected point in my life, I graduated from college and started working in IT. Actually, I first started working as a Java developer, but coding all day made my brain hurt because I couldn't ever stop working on the puzzle even when I went home for the day. So I went into IT and found it enjoyable in its own way, even if it's less respectable. (Let's be honest, in the hierarchy of technology roles, it's developers, then IT, then networking. Poor networking folks. Everyone blames the networking team because they don't understand how networking works and yet they are certain their application problems are caused by murky issues in the TCP/IP stack. This is why many of your networking colleagues are jaded assholes. It's your fault, really, because you've made them that way.)

When I first started working in IT, I assumed I was supposed to know everything and if I admitted to a lack of knowledge in any area, I would be immediately fired and the HR team would gather the staff together to laugh at me on my way out and then throw their pieces of chewed up gum in my hair. So when someone would say "we need to update the service principal name for that resource," I would say, "yeah, obviously the snervice prinpiple name." And then I would rush back to my workstation and Google snervice prinpiple name and get no results and then go cry alone in the lactation room.

That was a stupid way to live and I realize now what I should have said was "what's a service principal name?" and then let the senior person explain it. (As of this writing, I think I have about an 80% grasp on the concept of SPNs, but that's another topic.)

So anyway, I thought I'd make a blog for the people like me who are starting out and don't have the confidence to just say "explain that to me, motherfucker." I also thought it would be fun to use cuss words in my tech blog, because I'm edgy. Or maybe you have the confidence but you can't find a tutorial that just shows you how, say, a PKI works in goddamn plain English.

But wait, there's more! The developer part of my brain wasn't completely killed off, despite the amount of drinking I was doing in those days. I still like scripting, especially PowerShell. I also love, love, love automation. If I do the same task manually more than two times, then I'm going to automate it. Later on in my career, I stumbled across the concept of infrastructure-as-code and from there I finally understood how to approach automation like a real stallion.

This blog will attempt to do the following for a specific task or configuration.

1. Show the manual procedure so you get what's actually going on.
2. Show the scripted way of doing that same thing.
3. Show the infrastructure-as-code way of doing it.

Most of my experience is with Windows, so this will focus on Microsoft products with a tad bit of Linux. Also, the world has moved on to the cloud, and sticking with the Microsoft theme, my experience is primarily with Azure. For the record, I think Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems are all great and find it adorable when people have strong, angry opinions about the virtues of one over the other.

Why did you read this page? No one reads the about page. Thanks, I guess?

Now go out there and tackle your world! (Use the bathroom first, if you need to.)
