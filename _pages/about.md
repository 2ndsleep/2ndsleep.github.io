This blog is intended to be a repository for learning about Azure, IT, and automation. Azure has a ton of documentation, which is wonderful, but sometimes it feels like it was written for either braindead executives or super-geeks and nothing in between.

For example, here's the expository line describing a feature called [Azure landing zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/):

> Azure landing zones are the output of a multisubscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security, governance, networking, and identity.

What the filthy hell does that mean?? Well don't worry, just a few pages into the documentation you get this:

![Landing zone architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/media/ns-arch-expanded.png)

Ah, that clears it up. Okay, so what do I do if I'm not some idiot manager who's looking to impress other idiot managers with nicer cufflinks by repeating words like "multisubscription" and "governance," but I'm not a hyper-nerd who spends their evenings reading RFCs? Where do I go? Just a regular nerd who wants to spend their weekends doing normal people things, like bird-watching or filling their bathtub with butter and rolling around so they can feel the butter between their toes and in their armpits. Normal things.

## What's Here

This blog has two main goals:

- Explain how things actually work
- Show you how to automate your Azure environment

When you go to the [Start Learning](/services) page and then click on a service category, you'll be presented with links to the following items.

### Explainers

The explainers are write-ups to describe in plain English how things work. Like, suppose you're a fairly smart person but you're kind of starting out and you don't know 100% how DNS works, but you don't want to read a freaking white paper about it. Or maybe you're experienced but you just never got around to DNS. No shame. We can't know everything. This is a safe space. If you don't have the confidence leave the explainer up on your screen, keep a browser window open to the [AES ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Description_of_the_ciphers) Wikipedia page so you can look smart when your coworkers walk by.

### Procedures

The procedures will show you step-by-step how to do things manually or with automation. Each procedure will have the following sub-procedures.

1. Show the manual procedure so you get what's actually going on.
2. Show the scripted way of doing that same thing.
3. Show the infrastructure-as-code way of doing it.

## The Last Section

Why did you read this page? No one reads the about page. Thanks, I guess?

Now go out there and tackle your world! (Use the bathroom first, if you need to.)
