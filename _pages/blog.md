This site is really just a blog with a posts organized a certain way. The main unit of organization is a cloud **service**. This is usually a distinct cloud product that I think is worth learning, like virtual machines. It will usually be a single product, but may be a combination of products or touch on other products that are dependent on the service. For example, a virtual machine will mostly just be the virtual machine product, but you'll need to adjust the virtual network service where the VM will live, so the VM servie will touch on virtual networks a bit.

Each service's page will have two different types of posts: **explainers** and **procedures**. Explainers tell you how the service works in plain English. You can skip the explainers if you already know the topic pretty well. The procedures show you how to actually deploy the service using a DevOps approach.

Each service is part of a bigger fictional company called {{ site.fake_company_name }}. This company is building a website that helps you decide where you want to live. The blog entries progress with the development of this website, so depending on which procedure you choose, you'll see an example for a different point in time in the web development. The goal is to demonstrate the various cloud services, not the website, which is a pretty crappy website.

# [Start Learning](/guided)

If you're new to the cloud, you'll want to start here. This is a guided tutorial that will step you through the development of {{ site.fake_company_name }}'s website. Each service will build on the previous service.

# [Browse Topics](/browse)

Services are grouped together by topics, so if you're interested in a specific service, you can jump right into that service.

# [Useless Thoughts](/thoughts)

These are vanity posts about whatever I think is important. But important to me, definitely not important to anyone else.

# [All Posts](/posts)

Finally, if you just want to see all the posts in reverse order for whatever freaky reason, you can do that here.
