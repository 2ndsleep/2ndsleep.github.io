This blog is broken down into three parts. You can choose your own adventure, depending on what you're looking for.

## [Procedures](/services)

If you want to jump in and work with examples, go here.

## [Explainers](/explainers)

Try this if you're wanting to know how things work in general without reading a freaking white paper. Like, suppose you don't totally know how DNS works and you're too afraid to ask your coworker, this is your spot.

## [Thoughts](/thoughts)

Do you like reading the musings from insignificant people who think they are more important than they are? Then read my posts!
