# Why a Fractional CTO?

Small businesses often find that they have quite a lot of IT projects that need to be done, but can't justify hiring a full-time IT position. Wouldn't it be great if you had an IT resource for the following?

- Make sure your IT environment if configured optimally
- Protecting yourself from a cyber attack
- Knock out that small technical project that's too small to hire someone for
- Just ask a question from time to time

That's where a fractional CTO comes into play. You can engage Second Sleep as your IT resource for those projects that have been hanging over your head.

*In case you were afraid to ask, CTO stands for "Chief Technical Officer." No shame.*

# How Second Sleep Works

Here is a non-exhaustive list of services we provide.

## Security

You may think that cyber criminals have bigger fish to fry, but did you know that [72% of small businesses](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/publication/itrc-2023-business-impact-report/) have experienced a cyber attack? If you wake up in the middle of the night worrying about your business's security vulnerability but don't know where to being, Second Sleep can help you defend against these attacks without breaking the bank.

We start with the top security measures that are proven to greatly increase your security posture, such as multi-factor authentication. From there, we can do a deeper dive into your entire technology estate and implement further security protection, offering a fully monitored solution.

## Productivity

Signing up for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace is the easy part (sort of). After finally getting your email working, you find that you're still struggling with all the other collaboration tools, like file sharing, calendars, and task tracking. You may have even purchased additional services, like Dropbox and Asana.

Second Sleep can help you better integrate these additional tools into your current productivity suites. Or you can cancel these additional services altogether and use the same features that you're already paying for with your Google or Microsoft subscriptions.

## Advanced Services

Perhaps you've gotten a little fancy and have some additional technical services that you're not comfortable managing, like a database, custom software, or cloud services. We've got the expertise to help you out with these services, as well.
