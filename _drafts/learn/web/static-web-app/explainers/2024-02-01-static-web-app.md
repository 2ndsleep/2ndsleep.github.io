Azure has several options for hosting your **web application**. We're going to use an [Azure Static Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) because we just need a simple website without a lot of bells and whistles right now.<!--more--> This post will go over Static Web Apps but also do a quick explainer of why we're picking this one and what other options we'll use down the line.

## What Is a Static Web App?


## VS Code

VS Code has an efficient way to organize your work called [workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces). You often find yourself working on several projects at one time, constantly switching back and forth among them. Workspaces allow you collect all the various folders that are related to a project into a single pane of glass. When you need to turn your attention to another project, you can just switch to that workspace and all the folders are displayed. It will even remember which files you had open when you switch back to the workspace.

This is especially useful if you're a platform infrastructure engineer who is deploying an application, just like this scenario.
