Signing up for a cloud service is easy. So easy that I'm simply going to refer you to the links.
<!--more-->

- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free)

You'll see that both cloud providers will provide links to sign up for a free account. What I like about the free account is that it doesn't cost any money. I can use that money for other pursuits, like my model train hobby.

## Set a Spending Budget

But you are going to want to keep track of what you're doing after your free trial expires. If you're testing things, remove those resources after you're finished with them so you don't forget and then get hit with a $500 credit card bill next month. Use these instructions to set a budget limit.

## Whoops, I Closed My Browser

If signed up and then closed your browser and can't remember how to get back, here are the links for the administrator portals, which you'll probably memorize after working with this for a few weeks.

- [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com): `portal.azure.com`
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/): `console.cloud.google.com`
