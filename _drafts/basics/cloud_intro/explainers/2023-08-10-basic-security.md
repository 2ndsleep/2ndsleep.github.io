For example, you may create three management groups to represent the mega-facilities of your company: San Francisco, CA, New York, NY and Boerne, TX. Each of those management groups is made up of two subscriptions. For the whole tenant, you grant the Boerne engineering team the Owner role. You trust the talent in that small town, so they can manage all resources in all subscriptions. However, you recognize that there aren't many reliable engineers in all of San Francisco nor New York, so you assign the San Francisco engineering team the Reader role to the San Francisco management group and the New York engineering team the Contributor role to the New York Management group (because you trust them a little more).

But since you can't fully trust those New Yorkers, you create a policy to restrict which sizes of VMs the New York team can create in that management group.
