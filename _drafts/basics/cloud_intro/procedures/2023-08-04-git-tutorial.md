There's already a ton of Git tutorials out there, so I'm just going to point you to them.<!--more--> This will be another brief post.

I would suggest setting aside 8 hours either all at once or spread out over a few days to learn Git. I think it will take less time than that (no shame if not).

First, start with this short and sweet tutorial from this git-scm.com site: [gittutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).

Second, try one or both of these more extensive guided tutorials that have a prettier design.

- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com)
- [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com)

Finally and optionally, if you've got the guts, try the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) interactive tutorial. This starts out really easy and gets really hard really fast, for real.
