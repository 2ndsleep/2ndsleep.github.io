There's already a ton of Git tutorials out there, so I'm just going to point you to them.<!--more--> This will be another brief post.

I would suggest setting aside 8 hours either all at once or spread out over a few days to learn Git. I think it will take less time than that (no shame if not), but I'd be curious to know how long it takes until you feel confident enough to use it in real life.

First, start with this short and sweet tutorial from this git-scm.com site: [gittutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

Second, try the [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/) guided tour. It will step your through more advanced Git operations and has a pretty design.

Finally and optionally, if you've got the guts, try the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) interactive tutorial. This starts out really easy and gets really hard really fast, for real.
