|Service|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Azure Blob Storage|{% include reference.html item='blob_storage' anchor_text='Azure Blob Storage' %} is a way to store digital objects (aka, files). If those files happen to be static web content, you can turn the blob storage container into a [website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website).<br />**Pros:** very easy to configure<br />**Cons:** charge for storage (usually inexpensive); cannot use custom domains for HTTPS; must use advanced reverse proxy services for anything beyond the most basic site|
|Azure Static Web App|An Azure Static Web App is a web server for static web content. No code is executed on the web server, so this is generally used for front-end web services, but it includes an Azure Functions instance for a back-end API.<br />**Pros:** free for non-commercial sites; [reasonably-priced](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/static/) for production sites; includes Azure Functions for API; no reverse proxies needed if redundancy not required<br />**Cons:** not usable for server-side rendering|
|Azure Virtual Machines|Like almost any Azure service, you can always run your workload on a virtual machine. You can spin up a Linux or Windows VM and install your choice of a web server (Apache, Tomcat, IIS) and away you go!<br />**Pros:** full control over your web server's compute environment<br />**Cons:** more difficult to manage|
|Azure Spring Apps<super>*</super>|If you are a Java developer using the Spring framework, you can deploy your apps to the Azure Spring Apps service without having to manage the infrastructure. (Full disclosure, I probably won't ever do a post on this, even though I was a Spring developer for my first year out of college.)<br />**Pros:** no need to manage server infrastructure<br />**Cons:** only supports apps developed using Spring (not really a con, but I need to put something for this row)
|Azure App Service<super>*</super>|An Azure App Service is a full web hosting service for websites, web applications, and REST APIs. If you've developed your web application as a container, it supports hosting your containerized app, too, known as **Web App for Containers**.<br />**Pros:** can be used for front-end and back-end web applications; can integrate into your private network for access to resources such as databases; support for almost any modern language; support for containers<br />**Cons:** more complex than static web solutions; limited control over container management|
|Azure Container Instance<super>*</super>|If you've developed your web application as a container, you can deploy your app to an Azure Container Instance. This offers the least amount of container orchestration and is designed for deploying a single container without much in the way of high-availability. This works best for low-priority internal apps that can tolerate downtime.<br />**Pros:** easy to deploy container<br />**Cons:** designed for general-purpose containers, not specifically web applications|
|Azure Container Apps<super>*</super>|Azure Container Apps is a service to host your container application without having to know Kubernetes. This uses Kubernetes under the sheets, but provides a simpler management layer. You can think of this as "Kubernetes-light."<br />**Pros:** no need to manage Kubernetes<br />**Cons:** cannot fine-tune container orchestration|
|Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)<super>*</super>|If you've developed your web application as a container and require more management than is offered by Azure Container Apps, you can use AKS for the full Kubernetes experience.<br />**Pros:** can allocate more resources to your containers<br />**Cons:** more complex and requires knowledge of Kubernetes|
