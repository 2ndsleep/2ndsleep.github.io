If you are brand new to the cloud, it's time to get your hands dirty! Honestly, this tutorials won't teach you a ton about platform engineering, but creating your first resource will be a Karmic experience, connecting you to the cloud universe in a burst of ecstatic energy that will leave you viewing the world in a completely different way.

We're going to start with a resource type that you may surprisingly find you won't be using that often: virtual machines. Azure has perfectly good tutorials in their documentation, so this is just going to be a link to the tutorials.

:shower: Even though they say it in the documentation, make sure you clean up your resources so you don't get charged for resources you aren't using!
