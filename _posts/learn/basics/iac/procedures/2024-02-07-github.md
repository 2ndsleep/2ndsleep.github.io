As [previously stated]({% post_url /learn/basics/iac/explainers/2024-01-31-iac-overview %}#github), we'll be using GitHub to store and share our IaC files.<!--more-->

## Create GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one for free by following the instructions below.

[Create GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github){: .btn .btn--info}

## Create Infrastructure Repository

If you intend to reproduce the posts in this blog, you'll need to create a GitHub repository for you to store your IaC files. Click on the button :point_down: for instructions on creating a repository. You can name it anything you want, but we'll be using the name **scramoose-infrastructure** for these procedures, so you can use that same name if you plan on copying the examples here.

[Create New Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository){: .btn .btn--info}

Take note of the following:

- You'll probably want to make your repository private since you may decide to put sensitive-ish items in there, like your Azure subscription ID. But never any passwords or secrets (we know not to do that, right?). If you accidentally made it public, see [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) for information and instructions about making it private.
- Select the **Terraform** template in the dropdown box for **Add .gitignore**. If you didn't do this, I'll show you how to add it later.
