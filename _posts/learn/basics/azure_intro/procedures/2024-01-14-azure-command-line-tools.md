There are [many ways]({% post_url /learn/basics/azure_intro/explainers/2024-01-14-accessing-azure %}) to access Azure, but if you plan on using a command line, you'll need to install the appropriate tool.<!--more--> I have both the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell because I switch back and forth depending on what I'm trying to do. If you're not a PowerShell fan, install at least the Azure CLI.

Once again, Microsoft already has resources that explain how to do this, so I'm just linking to those.

[Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli){: .btn .btn--info}
[Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.1.0){: .btn .btn--info}

To use the [Azure Cloud Shell]({% post_url /learn/basics/azure_intro/explainers/2024-01-14-accessing-azure %}#azure-cloud-shell), no installation is needed! There's a [handful of ways](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview#multiple-access-points) to access it, but the quickest is to go to `shell.azure.com`.
