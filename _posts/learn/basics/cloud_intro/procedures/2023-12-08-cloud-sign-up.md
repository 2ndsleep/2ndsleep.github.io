Signing up for a cloud service is easy. So easy that I'm simply going to refer you to the link:

**[Create Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free)**

You'll notice the account is free. What I like about the free account is that it doesn't cost any money. I can use that money for other pursuits, like my model train hobby.

## Set a Spending Budget

But you are going to want to keep track of what you're doing after your free trial expires. If you're testing things, remove those resources after you're finished with them so you don't forget and then get hit with a $500 credit card bill next month. Use these instructions to set a budget limit.

**[Azure spending limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit)**

:calendar: Consider setting a reminder to check your Azure subscription the day before your trial is set to expire and delete all the resources you aren't using.

## Whoops, I Closed My Browser

If you signed up and then closed your browser and can't remember how to get back, you simply go to [`portal.azure.com`](https://portal.azure.com) which you'll probably memorize after working with this for a few days.
