Infrastructure as code is the way to define exactly what your cloud environment should look like using text-based files.
<!--more-->

This is the heart of this blog. When you start out using the cloud, the best way is to use the web interfaces. But doing that is slow, more error-prone, and is very tedious when you need, say, fifty virtual machines.

Instead, we write text-based files that describe what our cloud resources will look like. We then use these infrastructure as code files to deploy our cloud resources, ensuring they will turn out exactly how we wanted.
