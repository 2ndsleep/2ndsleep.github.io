Active Directory Domain Services is a directory that contains account information for users and other items in your network. In the olden days, you would create an username and password on a computer for each user that wanted to use that computer. This is a piss-poor way to do things if you have more than, well honestly, one person in your organization. What happens if a user wanted to use a different computer? Well, you'd have to create a user account on that new computer. What happens if the user changes their password on one computer? Now they have to remember two passwords. It's a mess!

Active Directory centralizes all the account management in one directory that represents something called a *domain*. Instead of creating accounts for a user named Priya on all the computers she might use, you create a single account in Active Directory. Now Priya can use her one account to log onto any computer that has been joined to the Active Directory domain.

Let's say one day Priya comes into work and says she's going to start stabbing people at work and HR's like, "whoa, that's not good." Hopefully she's joking, but they decide to get her safely to a therapist. Oh and they want to disable her account because she seems volatile. The IT department can disable her account and now she will not be able to log into anything.
