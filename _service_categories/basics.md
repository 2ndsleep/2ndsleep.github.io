There are tons of tutorials explaining how to get started with the cloud. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here, so I'll point you to those where appropriate. But doing the cloud the "right" way will involve some concepts like DevOps, infrastructure as code, and boring things like naming conventions. It may not be obvious when you're starting out why you'd want to bother with these details, but understanding and implementing these concepts earlier than later will make your life easier, trust me.
